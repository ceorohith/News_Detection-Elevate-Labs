Fake News Detection Web App – Project Report

Project Title:
Fake News Detection using OpenAI GPT and Streamlit

Objective:
To develop a web application that determines whether a news article is fake or real using OpenAI GPT-3.5.

Introduction:
Fake news is a growing concern in the digital age. This project leverages OpenAI’s GPT model and Streamlit to analyze and verify the authenticity of news content.

Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5)
- GitHub
- Streamlit Cloud

System Architecture:
Frontend (Streamlit UI) -> Backend (GPT-3.5 API) -> Response (Fake or Real with explanation)

Features:
- Analyze any news text
- GPT-3.5 powered analysis
- Instant response
- Secure key storage
- Live web app

How It Works:
1. User enters a news article.
2. App sends it to GPT-3.5.
3. GPT classifies it as Fake or Real.
4. Result displayed with reason.

Folder Structure:
